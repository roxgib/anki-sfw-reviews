Memory buffs will know that a bit of filth is like superglue for human memory. Unfortunately, adding dirty mnemonics or pics to Anki cards can get you into trouble if you're reviewing in public. This simple add-on adds a button to automatically bury NSFW notes, letting you review safely in public.

## Usage
After installing and relaunching Anki, select 'Bury NSFW Cards' under the 'Tools' menu to bury all cards with the 'nsfw' tag. To unbury, select 'Unbury NSFW Cards'. The add-on will remember which cards were buried, thereby avoiding accidentally unburying cards that were buried for other reasons e.g. siblings.

Don't forget to tag your cards with 'nsfw' if you want them buried!

## Misc
This is my first add-on for Anki, created mainly to help me learn about making add-ons.
